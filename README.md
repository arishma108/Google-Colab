### Cloning Voices with Tortoise AI
Introduction
I used an open-source AI tool called Tortoise to clone voices, including my own. Please remember that with great power comes great responsibility, so use this technology responsibly and ethically.

If you find this helpful consider starring this repository. Coz I'm lazy, I regularly find quick shortcuts on the latest AI techniques, making it easy to harness the power of AI.

#### Getting Started
To begin cloning voices, I need a few prerequisites:

-- Audio Track: Find/Record an audio track with the voice you want to clone. I used audio editing software Audition to create short 10-second clips of the desired voice. Save these clips are in WAV format.

-- Google Colab: I used Google Colab for this. It's a free platform that doesn't require hardware or coding knowledge. In Google Colab, you can run code blocks with ease.

#### Running the Code
Once in Google Colab, there are only a few settings to adjust in the code blocks.

-- Setting 1: Text Input
In the second code block, there's a variable to type or paste the text I want the AI to say. Modify this variable according to your preferences.

-- Setting 2: Audio Quality
I chose the output audio as high quality. Higher quality results in better voice cloning but may take longer to generate. If you're focused on accurate voice cloning, it's recommended to keep the highest quality setting.

#### Voice Cloning Process
To clone the voice, follow these steps:

-- Run the code blocks from top to bottom.
-- When you run the second code block, you'll be prompted to upload the audio files you prepared earlier. Upload these files (the more, the better for better results).
-- Once the audio files are uploaded, run the last code block and be patient. The AI will process the data and generate the cloned voice.
-- After processing, you can listen to the output to hear the cloned voice.

That's it! You've successfully cloned a voice using Tortoise AI. Keep in mind that with better audio quality and more sample clips, you can achieve even more convincing results.
